// Ids are base 32 strings whose binary representation corresponds to the
// position of a node in a tree.
// Every time the tree forks into multiple children, we add additional bits to
// the left of the sequence that represent the position of the child within the
// current level of children.
//

//   Fork 5 of 20       Parent id
//
// The leading 0s are important. In the above example, you only need 3 bits to
// represent slot 5. However, you need 5 bits to represent all the forks at
// the current level, so we must account for the empty bits at the end.
//
// For this same reason, slots are 1-indexed instead of 0-indexed. Otherwise,
// the zeroth id at a level would be indistinguishable from its parent.
//
// If a node has only one child, and does not materialize an id (i.e. does not
// contain a useId hook), then we don't need to allocate any space in the
// sequence. It's treated as a transparent indirection. For example, these two
// trees produce the same ids:
//
// <>                          <>
//   <Indirection>               <A />
//     <A />                     <B />
//   </Indirection>            </>
//   <B />
// </>
//
// However, we cannot skip any node that materializes an id. Otherwise, a parent
// id that does not fork would be indistinguishable from its child id. For
// example, this tree does not fork, but the parent and child must have
// different ids.
//
// <Parent>
//   <Child />
// </Parent>
//
// To handle this scenario, every time we materialize an id, we allocate a
// new level with a single slot. You can think of this as a fork with only one
// prong, or an array of children with length 1.
//
// It's possible for the size of the sequence to exceed 32 bits, the max
// size for bitwise operations. When this happens, we make more room by
// converting the right part of the id to a string and storing it in an overflow
// variable. We use a base 32 string representation, because 32 is the largest
// power of 2 that is supported by toString(). We want the base to be large so
// that the resulting ids are compact, and we want the base to be a power of 2
// because every log2(base) bits corresponds to a single character, i.e. every
// log2(32) = 5 bits. That means we can lop bits off the end 5 at a time without
// affecting the final result.
// TODO: Use the unified fiber stack module instead of this local one?
// Intentionally not using it yet to derisk the initial implementation, because
// the way we push/pop these values is a bit unusual. If there's a mistake, I'd
// rather the ids be wrong than crash the whole reconciler.
